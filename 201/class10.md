![js debugging](https://developer-chrome-com.imgix.net/image/admin/Tynv55DnsSgtvpd6Iz9z.png?auto=format)

Code debugging is based on a programming code that contain errors & sometimes they are difficult to fix. In often times if the programming code has errors nothing will happen which means there's no indication for searching the errors. When it comes to javascript debugging its not easy as it is because browsers nowadays have a built in javascript debugger which automatically searches for errors & fixes it & another thing to mention is the fact that those debuggers can be turned on & off which forces the errors to be sent to the developer.

![breakpoints](https://developer-chrome-com.imgix.net/image/admin/g9xQCASKEYBNWZoztC4G.png?auto=format)

Breakpoints are based on the programmer creating a code that will stop executing the programming process. As part of the debugging function, the lines of codes are marked as breakpoints. The programmer can go throught the program only one line or cause the program to run either to the last line, the next breakpoint or else it will crash.

![scope](https://dmitripavlutin.com/static/c0a319b3b08ab2c6e9a5aecef9e2e8e2/da8b6/javascript-nested-scopes.png)

As part of the information technology occupation, scope means the expected outcome of the product. However, in javascript it is based on managing the availability of variables which defines the concept of the variables whether they are global or local. It is a must situation for understanding the javascript scope because it demonstrates how to define the given variables in the javascript codes that are ready for execution.

![js errors](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/support/files/2020/07/chrome-devtools.png?resize=1024%2C633&ssl=1)

For developers who are willing to learn & implement javascript & its errors, understanding the errors throws an exception in which the interpreter stops & looks for exception handling code. As for objects, its easier to help the developer to find where the mistakes are made because the browser helps the developer by using its tools to read them & fix them. Those object errors occur when the syntax, variable references, data type, URI & range are written wrong which stops the execution. To deal with errors, the first thing the developer must do is to use the debugger which helps him to find the errors. Secondly, is to handle the errors properly by using the **try, catch and finally** statements.

![dev tools](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/p89rPkM8iyAQ0fqOzXypkAwlnNc=/1147x645/smart/filters:no_upscale()/001-web-browser-developer-tools-3988965-7b2957116c6d4a03b739d045ba7c6ea1.jpg)

Anytime a developer tries something to work he/she will use the console.log method for checking if the functions & other programming codes work. In additions, browsers consists of developer tools option which allows the developer to inspect the website's errors for testing & debugging purposes. Accessing the developer tools is simple the developer can either go to the browser's developer tools tab or simply right clicking on the inspect button to check on the console.

![tabular data](https://d585tldpucybw.cloudfront.net/sfimages/default-source/default-album/nested-objects-as-tables.png?sfvrsn=9324b4ec_1)

Writing a tabular data is based on building a table on the javascript console which takes a data which has to be an array or object. The code for implementing the table in the javascript console is writing **console.table()**.

![assert](https://apiumhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/assert.png)

Like the if else statements, the console method also has a conditional statement & that is assert. **Console.assert()** is based on the condition being met if the expression is false, but if the expression is true, nothing will happen.

[conditional breakpoints](https://blittle.github.io/chrome-dev-tools/sources/conditional-breakpoints.html)

Conditional breakpoints are based on indicating a breakpoint that should be triggered if the expression is true & like the assert method, it uses the available variables.

![handling exceptions](https://miro.medium.com/max/799/1*lhpdzg5aT-8m2In2KOHMmw.png)

Handling exceptions is based on if the code fails, the developer can use the **try catch and finally** methods.

* Try - It executes the code to the point where it lets the developer to test the block of errors in the code.

* Catch - This method is based on if there's an exception, it will run the code. This method works by letting the developer to handle the error.

* Finally - It will fully execute the code either in a success or failed outcome.
