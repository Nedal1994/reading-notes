# Class05 Summary

## HTML images

A lot of websites use images to make their website look more decent in terms of the concept & topic about it & it helps make a difference between the average looking website & an engaging website. Storing images on the developer's website is a good practice in case if the image was lost & it also supports the image by being downloaded in a folder next to the HTML files.

![directory structure](https://stuyhsdesign.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/directory-structure1.png)

When it comes to dealing files, its crucial to notice the fact the developer can assemble files into a structure which gathers all the contents together & also making sure that the materials remain in the folders with the webpage files. The structure that the website must have is not only based on linking materials & URLs in the HTML, but also the HTML file along with the CSS, JS files & images must be combined together. For file paths & image linking, it is similar to linking websites except the fact that it uses the **img** tag instead of the **a** tag. The **img** tag contains an **src** attribute which locates the path of the image file as well as the image link.

![image size](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/be/Set-Image-Width-and-Height-Using-HTML-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Set-Image-Width-and-Height-Using-HTML-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp)

When it comes sizing the image, developers can resize the images either from their tags or simply insert each image tag a class of its own & edit it on the CSS file. The image is resized based on its height & width which are specified in pixels in which they take longer time to be loaded in the HTML webpage.

Depending on the developer's choice, the image can placed wherever the developer feels satisfying because sometimes it affects the design of the webiste. The developer can place the image either before the before the paragraph, after the paragraph, inside the paragraph or in the middle of the paragraph.

![align](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Align-Something-in-HTML-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-460px-Align-Something-in-HTML-Step-3-Version-4.jpg.webp)

When it comes to image alignment, its important note that teh developer can align the image either on the top, bottom left, right or even in the center of the webpage. If the developer wants to align the image horizontally, then the align is always on the left or right. However the vertical alignment is only positioned in the top, middle & bottom of the page.

![tools](https://www.x-cart.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_design_tools.jpg)

When it comes to the developer's skills, it is a mandatory factor that web designing & programming sometimes require people with graphic design skills because it allows the developer to create images & logos for the website that is yet to be done. Most skilled developers use tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Microsoft Paint & so on. Developers use these tools because they are crucial for web designing & especially programming.

## HTML Colors

![colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/img_colormap.gif)

Its easy to say the fact that all websites require color according to their topic & concept. There are many methods in HTML to color the website's text & background elements, but the bottom line is the fact that there color properties that the developer must ensure the elements are colored in different properties & those properties are:

* Stating the color in names such as color:red;

* Stating the color in RGB values such as rgb(255,0,0)

* Stating the colors in hex codes such as #FF0000

These properties can be applied in any element of the HTML besides the text & background.

Understanding the colors is extremely important because every color in the computer screen is mixed with RGB & for the developer to understand the color factors, he/she can use the color picker which gives the developer to write the color property in any way he/she feels satisfying, but if the developer already has experience with colors, then they can design the website a lot quicker.

![rgba](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/refreshdc-html5css3-090719085307-phpapp01/95/up-to-speed-on-html-5-and-css-3-36-728.jpg?cb=1252999046)

RGBA is different from the RGB because the RGBA specifies the red, green, blue & the opacity. The opacity is based on the element's presentation which only takes between 0.0 (fully transparent) & 1.0(fully opaque).

[hsla](https://elad.medium.com/why-css-hsl-colors-are-better-83b1e0b6eead)

The HSL/HSLA stands for "hue saturation  lightness & alpha". It works similar to the RGB, but it works in a method where the color can be manipulates with lightness & saturation.

* Hue - It is based on the color that is picked from a palette of 360 colors.

* Saturation - It describes the color's saturation in which the color has a value between 0% (grey) & 100% (full color).

* Lightness - It describes the color's brightness in which consists of values between 0% (black) & 100% (white)

* Alpha - Like the RGB, it controls the color's opacity which determines the transparency of the color.

## HTML text editing

For HTML, its fundamental to state the fact that the text must appear decently depending on its size & style. Speaking of size & style, sizing the text is based on sizing the fonts & fonts are based on the text's looks. The developer has a lot of options to choose from regarding text editing & the fact is those texts can changed through HTML & CSS.

![fonts](https://i1.wp.com/www.tutorialbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Font-in-HTML.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&ssl=1&is-pending-load=1)

For font editing, it depends on the developer's choice to change the text's size, color & style. However, the developer must make a decision to publish the website in a way that people feels satisfied with the design of the website. Scaling the text is important which allows the developer to resize the text in any way he/she wants to because resizing texts can be changed through either of those units:

* Pixels (Example: 12px)
* Percentages (Example: 200%)
* EMS (Example: 2em)


![bold and italic](https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/WD/images/chapter1/webpage_B_I_tags.gif)

The bold text is based on the text becoming bolder which indicates the text is important. The bold text also represents the section of the text which not only the text is bolder, but also it doesn't mean anything.


The Italic text works similar to the bold text; however, the italic is different because once the user implements an italic tag in the paragraph the text is displayed in a curved way. Depending on what the user implements, the italic text represents the text that identifies names & words that are italicized stylistically.

![underline](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/412574.image0.jpg)

Underlining the text is based on the text that has a line under it. It uses the **u** tag which is given to the text in the HTML & underlining text is most likely used for text types such as hyperlinks, bolder texts & vice versa.

![uppercase & lowercase](https://www.htmlgoodies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CSS-uppercase-and-CSS-lowercase_fig2.gif)

Uppercase is a property that allows the text to appear in capital letters. On the other hand, the lowercase property allows the text to appear in small letters. These properties can be done in the CSS using the text-transform property.
* Example: text-transform: uppercase;
* Example: text-transform: lowercase;

![text align](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-434.png)

The text alignment property allows the developer to control the alignment of the text horizontally & vertically. This property can be done either in the HTML or CSS. The alignment properties consists of values such as:
* Left
* Right
* Center
* Justify
* Top
* Bottom

## JPEG, PNG & GIF

![JPEG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/JPEG_example_flower.jpg)

JPEG stands for "Joint Photographic Experts Group" which is a lossy compression of the image. It is most likely used for digital photography which are compressed & because it is lossy it has a unique compression in which it is quick & efficient for sharing & it is widely used on the Internet, computers & phones. They contain high quality image data with a lossless compression.

![png](https://convertpng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.png)

PNG stands for "Portable Network Graphics" & based on that, it can be opened with any browser or image programs. It is uncompressed because they display transarent backgrounds, but it doesn't contain animations. PNG is useful for editing illustrations, designing websites, editing logos & vice versa.

GIF stands for "Graphic Interchange Format" & based on its popularity it used in the Internet because of its wide support base & portability. GIF supports up to 8 bits per pixel in images which allows 256 colors to be used in one image. Like the PNG, it can be useful for editing & it supports animation.

### When to use:

* JPEG - Using this file format for photography, printing & previewing purposes which gives the user flexibility for editing the file format.

* PNG - Using this file format for editing the transparency of images that has background color or images.

* GIF - This is most widely used for animation purposes & like the PNG, used for editing the transparency.
