When it comes to text in HTML, its always important to add headings. The heading is a title above a section in which it structures the content of the webpage. In HTML, the heading consists of 6 different sizes from the biggest (h1) to the smallest (h6).


![paragraphs](https://static.javatpoint.com/htmlpages/images/html-paragraph.png)

Paragraphs are based on defining words written on the webpage. Paragraphs always start with a new line in which the browser can spaces between words. The browser can remove extra spaces & lines when the wepage is displayed. For new lines, the user can implement a long paragraph but with a feature that makes the paragraph continue in a separate line which is the break tag.

![bold and italic](https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/WD/images/chapter1/webpage_B_I_tags.gif)

The bold text is based on the text becoming bolder which indicates the text is important. The bold text also represents the section of the text which not only the text is bolder, but also it doesn't mean anything.


The Italic text works similar to the bold text; however, the italic is different because once the user implements an italic tag in the paragraph the text is displayed in a curved way. Depending on what the user implements, the italic text represents the text that identifies names & words that are italicized stylistically.

In HTML text formatting, there are 2 methods that can be used for inserting small texts with the paragraph & they are the superscripts & subscripts tags.

The subscript adds a text which defines the subscript text which appears **below** the line & rendered smaller fonts. Subscripts can be used for chemical & mathematical formulas.

The superscript works the same method as the subscript with the exception of the text appearing **above** the line & rendered in smaller fonts. Like the subscripts, it can be also used for chemical & mathematical formulas, but also works for footnotes as well.

![quotation](https://s1.o7planning.com/en/12467/images/47158484.png)

Quotations are elements which contains quotation marks. For short quotations, it uses the **q** tags. There's also another method for quotation in HTML & that is blockquotes.

![blockquotes](https://static.javatpoint.com/htmlpages/images/html-blockquote-tag.png)

Blockquotes are elements that is used for longer text which takes the entire paragraph. The browser usually displays the content within the **blockquote** tag as an indented text because the paragraph elements are inside the blockquote tags. Another thing to mention is the fact that blockquotes define the section that is quoted from another source.

When it comes to changes in a content in HTML, its important to note that inserting & deleting elements show the inserted text & the deleted text appears as a struck text.

![css](https://i1.wp.com/www.tutorialbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Types-of-CSS.png?fit=795%2C1115&ssl=1)

Cascading style sheet is based on the website's design that is implemented in the HTML file or in a separate CSS file depending the developer's choice. CSS styles the HTML document which describes how the HTML elements are displayed.

CSS consists of 3 methods:
 * Inline
 * Internal
 * External

Depending on the developer's choice, its important to note that inline & internal styling are done inside the HTML file because the inline style is applied to a single element while the internal style is done in the head element by applying the style tags which literally styles more than one element in the HTML. The external styling works the same as the internal except the fact that its done in a separate css file. However, the developer must link the css file in the HTML file by simply implementing the link tag with the reference path of the css file & the relationship between the HTML file & the file that is linked with it.

![selectors](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/97/96/bc97965579512f8a6d2303934f599c65.png)

Its important to notice the fact that CSS requires mandatory selectors for styling purposes. Those selectors are based on selecting the elements for styling, but also important to note that those elements have certain selectors depending on what the developer is implementing. Those elements have selectors which makes them totally different from styling.

The selectors work in the css in which the developer feels satisfying. Those selectors have types of styling:

* Universal selectors are based on styling the entire elements in the HTML by simply using the * symbol in the css

* Type selectors are based on matching the elements' names which targets certain tag for styling such as the headings & paragraphs

* Class selectors are based on the element that has a class attribute which implies the value of the element which makes it different from other elements of styling. The class selectors are styled like this: 
    * .note()
    * p.note()

* ID selectors work similar to the class selectors with the exception of having the id attributes which matches the exact same value given in the selector. It works like this:

     *  #intro

## Javscript

Javascript consists of statements that a computer can follow in which the programming ends with a semicolon. Like the other programming languages, javascript consists of adding comments which not only explains the codes, but also helps the users to read it so that they can take notes from it.

![variables](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Declare-a-Variable-in-Javascript-Step-2.jpg/aid1337336-v4-728px-Declare-a-Variable-in-Javascript-Step-2.jpg.webp)

Javascript consists of declaring variables in which it can be given a name which is written in a way that they contain data by storing it. Variables can be used to declare numbers & letters for operations such arithmetics, assignment, logical, etc...

Assigning a value in the variables depends on the data type that the developer is using, but also depends on the operations that he/she is using. The variables can help store the data which can be numbers, string & vice versa, but on the other hand, it also helps by changing the value in the variable itself.

![arrays](https://miro.medium.com/max/1130/1*wc0QOYZUVvabyZYVfdzvTQ.png)

Arrays are variables which holds more than one value which are listed in a way that they are related to each other. They are very useful because it specifies the list of items that are displayed & at the same time, it holds the number of values in which the developer can implement.

![numbering](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190627130914/array-21.png)

Numbering an array is an important step of creating it because each item or value must have an index number. Index numbers are zero based numbers in which rather than starting from 1, the value will be given instead a 0 index. 

![Operators](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/JavaScript-Operators-1200x720.jpg)

Javascript consists of expressions & operators which are similar to other programming languages (python, java, c, etc...)

There so many operators that work in terms of values, but those operations work based on mathematics & comparisions.

![Assignment](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zIQKbpmdKa4/maxresdefault.jpg)
Assignment operators are based on variables that can be added, subtracted, muiltiplied, divided & vice versa. Assignment operators also consists of AND, OR comparisons which states that which variables are similar & different.

![Comparison](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFB-ywsNPwg/maxresdefault.jpg)
Comparison or relational operators are based on which variables are equal, greater than, less than & so on.  Comparision operations work by returning a logical value based on which comparison is true. Depending on the variable that is implemented by the user, the variables can be numerical, string, object or logical values. Javascript gives the user the ability to convert those operators to find the real output based on which value is true or false.

![Logical](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JavaScript-Logical-Operator.png)
Like the assignment operators, logical operators actually uses Boolean statement values which returns values that are similar or different from each other. Logical operators mainly uses AND, OR, NOT.

![Arithmetic](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JavaScript-Arithmatic-Operators.png)
Arithmetic operators are based on taking numerical values by returning them in a single value & those operators work by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & remainder.

[Void](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void)
### Void operator
The void operator is based on values that are defined without being returned

# Loops

![For loop](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L7nVZZQEnZU/maxresdefault.jpg)

## for loops
The for loop is a statement that specifies the conditions which are falsly evaluated in which the initial expression is executed, then the conditional expression is evaluated & then the statement is executed.

* for(i=0;i<5;i++)
* This example above is a simple for loop statement which indicates the initial expression which is (i=0), then the conditional statement implies that the i must be less than 5 & then the statement is completely executed

## while loop
While loop is based on executing the statements before evaluating the condition that states to be true. If the condition is false, the loop will stop executing & then passes the following statement.

* x = 0
* y = 0
* while (x < 5)
{
  x++;
  x+=y;
}

## If else statements
[IF else](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)

They are based on conditional statements that if the value is true, then the code block is executed, but if its false, then the second code block will continue to run instead.

## Switch statements
[switch](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp)

They are similar to the if else statements in which this time the variable with a switch value. The switch statement is conditional because it consists of cases of variables in which if one case is false, it will continue to the next case. The difference between the switch & if else statements is the fact that the switch has a default option if none of the cases are matching with each other. Unlike the if else statment, the switch consists of the break statement which stops the rest of the coding process if the matching value is found true.
