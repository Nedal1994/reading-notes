For animation purposes, the CSS allows the animation of the HTML elements without using javascript or flash. The animation property allows the developer to change from one style to another, but to do the animation the developer must specify the keyframes.

The keyframe rule is based on specifying the animation codes & it is mandatory because the animation is created by changing from one set of styles to another, but it allows the developer to change the style many times. Specifying the style can be changed in percentages from 0% to 100%. 0% means the start of the animation & 100% is the finishing point of the animation which means that the animation is complete
