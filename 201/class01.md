When it comes to markups, it is important to implement DOCTYPES markup because it indicates the current version (which is HTML5) of the HTML that the user is using.

The difference between the id and class attributes is the fact that id attirbutes are unique while classes are not. The class attribute is used to point to a class name in the style sheet & it can be used in javascripts for manipulating elements with a class name. The id attribute is unique because it specifies an id element from the HTML element & it points to a style decoration in the style sheet.

HTML5 layouts consists of new set of elements which allows the user to split the webpage into several parts & each of those parts has its own set of contents. In HTML5, there's a new element tag that is added which checks the version of the HTML that the user is using which is DOCTYPE HTML

The header element represents a container that introduces a set of content which typically contains more headings, images & so on. The footer element represents the document which contains copyright details, contact detials & so on.

When it comes to processing & designing, any website must done for the target audience which are the customers (or users). The target audience are based on users' that are individuals or group of individuals such as companies. Depending on the individual, it is important to note that the website must be done in a user interface & experience method which fits those people that help access certain options in a simple way. People must visit the developer's webiste because they want to know who you are & consider why you are doing this website for them. As for the developer, he/she is doing this website for the people because the developer can get the positive feedback & satisfaction from the people.

Javascript is considered as the world's most popular programming language because it is not just a compiled language, but a translated language which creates interactive websites. It is also known as the ABC of programming because it is a script of instructions that the computer can achieve a purpose. 

The purpose that the computer can achieve is based on defining the goals, designing the script & code each step that has tasks to be written in a flowchart in which the computer can understand & follow.

Flowcharts are very crucial to the javascript because it gives the user an ability to integrate a visualization for application development & at the same time, it reflects the development process in a way that it illustrates the process to be understood completely which helps finds errors to be detailed properly.

Computers use javascript to create models of the world using data processes which help define the objects & properties. Objects are based on physical things that can be represented to anyone while properties are based on the characteristics of the objects which consists of a name & value.

Objects also consists of methods which represent things that people need to do with objects in which they can update the values of the object's properties. 

Fitting HTML, CSS & Javascript all together is a mandatory method which allows the user to edit the options in terms of design, scripts & elements arrangement. Javascript works in HTML 2 ways:
* Link the js file in the HTML file
* Implement the script tag inside the HTML file & implement javascript codes
