## HTML images

A lot of websites use images to make their website look more decent in terms of the concept & topic about it & it helps make a difference between the average looking website & an engaging website. Storing images on the developer's website is a good practice in case if the image was lost & it also supports the image by being downloaded in a folder next to the HTML files.

When it comes to dealing files, its crucial to notice the fact the developer can assemble files into a structure which gathers all the contents together & also making sure that the materials remain in the folders with the webpage files. The structure that the website must have is not only based on linking materials & URLs in the HTML, but also the HTML file along with the CSS, JS files & images must be combined together. For file paths & image linking, it is similar to linking websites except the fact that it uses the **img** tag instead of the **a** tag. The **img** tag contains an **src** attribute which locates the path of the image file as well as the image link.

When it comes sizing the image, developers can resize the images either from their tags or simply insert each image tag a class of its own & edit it on the CSS file. The image is resized based on its height & width which are specified in pixels in which they take longer time to be loaded in the HTML webpage.

Depending on the developer's choice, the image can placed wherever the developer feels satisfying because sometimes it affects the design of the webiste. The developer can place the image either before the before the paragraph, after the paragraph, inside the paragraph or in the middle of the paragraph.

When it comes to image alignment, its important note that teh developer can align the image either on the top, bottom left, right or even in the center of the webpage. If the developer wants to align the image horizontally, then the align is always on the left or right. However the vertical alignment is only positioned in the top, middle & bottom of the page.

The background image is one of the most important things that any web developer can implement because it gives the website a new look & a new way to promote the contents for the website's topic. The background image property allows the developer to place the image behind any HTML element. Depending on the developer's choice, this property can be implemented on both the HTML & CSS

SEO or Search Engine Optimization is a process which improves the website by increasing its visibility so that users can search for products & services & search engines could be related to business companies such as Google, Bing & vice versa. The better visibility of the search results gives the users the attention to attract certain details.

Its fair to say that videos & audios is a great way to be implemented on the website because it advertises the fact that the website should be promoted & at the same time, it will help satisfy users for using it. For implementing videos in HTML, it uses the **video** tag which allows the developer to get the source of the video, the type of the video & also allows the developer to resize it depending on the website's design plans. As for the audio, it works the way similar to the video, but this time it uses the **audio** tag.
