Anybody who have experience with web design & programming we are all familiar with forms (or HTML forms) & forms are based on boxes that collects user input which is mostly sent to the server for processing. When it comes to React forms, it works similar to the HTML forms, but this time it works with React programming in which the they are formed in components in which Javascript & some HTML codes are implemented when handling events.

In general programming, conditional operations such as if statements, while statements, etc... are nothing strange to programmers or software developers. However, in React it works similar to other programming languages except the fact that it uses components which contain arrow functions that display unfamiliar codes. Now the process works by not only implementing unfamiliar codes, but also rendering the conditional statements by implementing conditional operations.
