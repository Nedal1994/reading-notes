The Call Stack in Javascript is based on keeping track of multiple funcation calls. It is a like a stack of data where it is pushed & follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It executes the contexts such as the global & function execution contexts through the JS engine which manages these execution contexts in which the JS engine uses the call stack. As far as how many ‘calls’ can happen at once, it only happens 50 calls. Last In First Out or (LIFO) is based on a method that stores the recent items.

Stack overflow is based on using more memory for the program's stack which was supposed to be used. What causes the stacks to overflow is whenever programmers make the mistake by calling functions over & over again which works for the most part, but the input will cause it to go in circles until the computer recognizes that the stack is overblown.

For developers who are willing to learn & implement javascript & its errors, understanding the errors throws an exception in which the interpreter stops & looks for exception handling code. As for objects, its easier to help the developer to find where the mistakes are made because the browser helps the developer by using its tools to read them & fix them. Those object errors occur when the syntax, variable references, data type, URI & range are written wrong which stops the execution. To deal with errors, the first thing the developer must do is to use the debugger which helps him to find the errors. Secondly, is to handle the errors properly by using the **try, catch and finally** statements.

Code debugging is based on a programming code that contain errors & sometimes they are difficult to fix. In often times if the programming code has errors nothing will happen which means there's no indication for searching the errors. When it comes to javascript debugging its not easy as it is because browsers nowadays have a built in javascript debugger which automatically searches for errors & fixes it & another thing to mention is the fact that those debuggers can be turned on & off which forces the errors to be sent to the developer.
