# Read03 Summary

The React allows the developer to define the components as classes or functions in a way that it uses methods during its lifecycle which allows the developer to update the UI & application status. The React lifecycle consists of 3 phases:
* Mounting
* Updating
* Unmounting

## Mounting phase

This phase is based on the fact that an instance of a component is being created & inserted into the DOM which occurs during the mounting phase.

## Updating phase

This phase is based on the component is updated which is re-rendered.

## Unmounting phase

This is the last phase of the lifecycle because the component is being removed from the DOM.

The React Bootstrap is a front end framework which replaces the Bootstrap Javascript in which each component has been built as a true React component without using JQuery. React Bootstrap has been transitioned & growing with the React which is very useful for the UI process.

Handling the events with React is similar to the Javascript event handling except that it converts the string using camelCase.
