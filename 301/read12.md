HTTP status codes are based on the fact that they are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server & they are three-digit responses from the server to the browser-side request. Those codes actually means that there's a communication between the server & the browser in which there are multiple code classes based on the type of information they are communicating. The HTTP status codes are divided into 5 sections (or categories):

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 100-199 | They are informational codes which are based on telling the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. Like using a different protocol or telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body.|
| 200-299 | They are successful codes which are based on informing the client  that its request was accepted.|
| 300-399 | They are redirectional codes that tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore |
| 400-499 | They are client error codes which are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server |
| 500-599 | They are server error codes which indicate the problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server |

CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) is based on the fact that it defines the most basic API actions for persistent storage which can be referred to any data storage device that retains power after the device is powered off, such as a hard disk. Organizations that keep track of customer data, accounts, payment information, health data, & other records require data storage hardware and applications that provide persistent storage. This data is typically organized into a database, which is simply an organized collection of data that may be viewed electronically.

Middleware is based on a software that provides services to applications instead of what its OS is offering such as data management, application services, messaging, authentication & API management. It helps developers build applications more efficiently because it acts like the connective tissue between applications, data, & users. It provides services that enable different applications & services to communicate using common messaging frameworks such as JSON, REST, XML, SOAP, or any other web services & also it provides services that enable components written in multiple languages such as Java, C++, PHP & Python for communicational purposes.

express.json() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: app.use(express.json()).

![500 error](https://linuxhint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/internal_Server_Error_500-01.png)

500 Internal Server Error is based on an HTTP status code which indicate that the server contains errors internally. The 500 error code is a generic message that appears when something unexpected happened on the web server & the server can’t offer more specific information. However, there are  ways to quickly get around the problem because this error message is often temporary & the website may quickly fix itself.
