Google learned from its quest to build a perfect team which gave them the data analysis based on the fact that they interviewed 180 teams within the company which helped them find the team that not so relevant. The researchers of Google found themselves that they are the real characteristics of the company which has a meaning, impact, structure, clarity dependability & everybody felt safe in taking risks.

Google established the right team norms which is basically an individual could have enemies on the team or could have certain individuals who don't get along very well. From a psychological standpoint, its always important to know the fact that any company always consists of people getting jealous from each other or they don't feel comfortable working with each other.

The reason why Google's team performed poorly is because sometimes those individuals could either have a conflict with each other or sometimes could delay their work which could be a huge risk of possibly cancelling a certain project.
