Functional programming is based on building the structure & elements of computer systems which stresses the combination of unctions & at the same time, it treats the function as objects which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions which are assigned to variables & created dynamically. It encourages developers to write the code that doesn't mutate the data which tells them to treat the programs as mathematical functions because the outcome produces identical results which are the same values that are passed into them.

Pure functions are based on functions that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in & it doesn't depend on any state or data that could change the program's executions, but the only thing that pure functions depend on is its input arguments. Pure functions are not limited to make HTTP requests or other tasks such as data mutation, mathematical functions & so on. Here are some benefits related to pure functions:

* It is easier to combine because the output depends only on the input.

* It is easier to test & debug because the output not only depends on the input & algorithm, but in contrast that debugging determines the data was called.

Immutability is based on the data not being changed nor mutated & it is the core principle in functional programming because it is applied at the object level which never allows the developer to change the codes whatsoever.

Referential transparency is based on an expression that is replaced by its value without changing the result of the program which means that the methods should always return the same value for a given argument with no effect. Referential programming is most likely used for mathematical functions which are composed of subprograms which are the programs themselves.
