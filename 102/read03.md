Wireframing gives the user an inspiration which gives the user a method to create & draw the web design by hand & then later implement it on the program.

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language" which defines the structure of the content. HTML consists of elements that appear in many certain methods. HTML works by using tags which creates words & hyperlinks.

HTML also consists of semantics which means that it is a piece of codes that runs in different tags which allows the user to insert different parts of the tags to make the design look appropriate. Those tags include:
- Headers
- Footers
- Sections
- Navigation tags
- Vice versa
