The growth mindset is **Important**

Having a growth mindset is *Mandatory*

# Growth mindset

It is a mindset in which a person can utilize by giving himself a chance to try & learn new things in life. It enables the person to achieve greater success by fulfilling his objectives in terms of embracing the productivity & creativity which would develop preserverance, intelligence & effort. The growth mindset occurs on the person when he has the ability to accept challenges & obstacles by persisting them properly & this type of mindset allows the person to accept criticism rather than complaining about it. Once those challenges are completely done, then the person has the mindset of growing & developing himself in a whole new level.

Anytime a person is faced with a challenge at first he/she might not accept it or simply ignoring it which is a tough struggle from the start in which the person's mindset is fixed. However, if the person is willing to accept the challenges & not letting himself down, then he can embrace those challenges by simply doing whatever task is handed to him. Once the challenges are done then the person must be able face the obstacles in which he/she must persist to focus on the task at hand & once that's done, he/she has the effort to take the tasks or work seriously. Then later on the person will get criticised & the options is up to the person & those options are either ignore or accept. If the person accepts criticism, he'll achieve better goals. If the person doesn't accept criticism, it would affect his future.

In my mind I always vision myself to be great. For me to able to deal with it I wanted to see for myself to be able to adapt & tolerate any challenge that comes to me & it will be a tough situation in my mindset, but I'll able to get used to it & at the same time, it will grow my mind into a heavy duty mind which makes my personality stronger both inside & outside the work. The heavy duty mindset which I call it is the mindset that I wanted to achieve my future objectives because the the heavy duty mindset has the ability to focus on the work properly & be willing to able to adapt & tolerate everything which makes the person more bolder in a way that I can do anything difficult & be able to move forward. For me its all about getting hit & keep moving forward to be able to achieve my objectives & that is to me winning.
