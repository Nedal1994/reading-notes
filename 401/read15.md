Binary tree is a tree data structure composed of nodes, each of which has at most, two children, referred to as left and right nodes. The tree starts off with a single node known as the root. 

* The nodes in the tree are based on components which  contain itâ€™s own values & references to other nodes

* The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

* Left node - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

* Right node - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

* A leaf is a node that does not have any children

* The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

* Depth First - It is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root.

* Breadth First - It iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node

If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.

* Breadth first traversal - Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth first traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down a list of children of length k, instead of checking for the presence of a left and a right child.
