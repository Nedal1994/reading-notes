When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.

If you have heard the saying “measure twice and cut once,” then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.

The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.

You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

This is based on the fact that people being busy makes your mental health more stronger than weaker because it allows you to have the ability to not overthink of anything else besides what you're doing. Busyness is NOT a sign of weakness whatsoever because people are focused on what they're doing rather than being empty minded. The fact that people are successful means **BOTH** busy & focused on their occupation which helps them succeed in their lives.

## Think like a programmer

If you want to think like a programmer, then you have to be able to decide on how can you manage the programming yourself by simply doing those steps:

1. Understanding the main idea of the programming concept based on the fact that you can implement the codes on making that specific program

2. Planning the conceptual idea for the program to be implemented the right way

3. Dividing the issues into sub-issues is very important because solving a hard problem is extremely difficult for the first time.

4. If you're stuck, its ok because it will later help you become more experienced in programming & know more of it later.

The 5 Whys strategy is a simple, effective tool for uncovering the root of a problem. You can use it in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and quality-improvement initiatives. Here are steps on how to use the 5 whys:


* Assemble a Team
* Define the Problem
* Ask the First “Why?”
* Ask “Why?” Four More Times
* Know When to Stop
* Address the Root Cause(s)
* Monitor Your Measures
