A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions

**Types of linked lists**

* Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

* Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

* Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.


Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
