AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner. 

* The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services. 

* Each Lambda function runs in its own container. 

* When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new container and then executes that container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines managed by AWS. 

* Before the functions start running, each function’s container is allocated its necessary RAM and CPU capacity. 

* Once the functions finish running, the RAM allocated at the beginning is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running. 

* The customers then get charged based on the allocated memory and the amount of run time the function took to complete.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

* A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 

* CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. 

* The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page. 

* When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content. 

* CDNs will also communicate with the originating server to deliver any content that has not been previously cached. 

* In turn, the speed is improved by distributing content closer to the website visitors by using a nearby CDN server, causing visitors to experience faster page loading times. 

* In simpler terms, for example, instead of a user in London trying to access a server in LA, which can cause slower Internet speeds, the user would be redirected through a CDN that is geographically closest to them (London, Paris, Stockholm, etc). 

* As of today, the majority of web traffic goes through through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.
