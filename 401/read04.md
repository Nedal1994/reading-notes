![tdd](https://marsner.com/wp-content/uploads/test-driven-development-TDD.png)

It is a software engineering practice of writing unit tests before writing the production code which provides a structure to the coding process & as a result, it writes a code with a major purpose.

**Advantages of TDD**

* **Better program design and higher code quality** - When writing tests, programmers first have to define a goal they will achieve with the code piece. Developers estimate an experience it will give and the way it will match with other pieces of the entire code. A developer keeps in mind everything, from an interface to a work plan.

* **Detailed project documentation** - When writing tests for particular requirements, programmers immediately create a strict and detailed specification. It already includes all the likely users’ actions.


* **TDD reduces the time required for project development** - It’s widely known that both web and cross-platform apps like PWAs created with Test Driven Development take longer than ones created without TDD. Some sources mention the difference of about 30 percent.

The difference is beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and  invites inexperienced users to share state between tests

The downside of TDD is slow process. If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations. you would like to believe the interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you’ll finally start writing the code.

| ES6  | Constructors  |
|---|---|
| It ensures that this keyword used by the developer is referring to the object being created by the developer.  |  Any function can be used as a function constructor and it primarily focuses on the creation of reusable object creation code. |
| Its syntax is similar to object creation in other object-oriented programming languages.  |  Its syntax is unique and is not generally found in other object-oriented programming languages. |

REST API is based on a method for 2 computers that communicate over HTTP which is similar to web browsers & servers. However, sharing the data between 2 or more systems is a very crucial requirement for software develpment. Based on the fact that REST APIs are designed around resources, it consists of many types of objects, data or service that can be accessed by the client in which the resource is considered as an identifier. It provides flexibility which allows developers to build an API that meets your needs while also meeting the needs of very diverse customers.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.
