![Operators](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/JavaScript-Operators-1200x720.jpg)

Javascript consists of expressions & operators which are similar to other programming languages (python, java, c, etc...)

There so many operators that work in terms of values, but those operations work based on mathematics & comparisions.

![Assignment](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zIQKbpmdKa4/maxresdefault.jpg)
Assignment operators are based on variables that can be added, subtracted, muiltiplied, divided & vice versa. Assignment operators also consists of AND, OR comparisons which states that which variables are similar & different.

![Comparison](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFB-ywsNPwg/maxresdefault.jpg)
Comparison or relational operators are based on which variables are equal, greater than, less than & so on.  Comparision operations work by returning a logical value based on which comparison is true. Depending on the variable that is implemented by the user, the variables can be numerical, string, object or logical values. Javascript gives the user the ability to convert those operators to find the real output based on which value is true or false.

![Logical](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JavaScript-Logical-Operator.png)
Like the assignment operators, logical operators actually uses Boolean statement values which returns values that are similar or different from each other. Logical operators mainly uses AND, OR, NOT.

![Arithmetic](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JavaScript-Arithmatic-Operators.png)
Arithmetic operators are based on taking numerical values by returning them in a single value & those operators work by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & remainder.

[Void](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void)
### Void operator
The void operator is based on values that are defined without being returned

# Loops

![For loop](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L7nVZZQEnZU/maxresdefault.jpg)

## for loops
The for loop is a statement that specifies the conditions which are falsly evaluated in which the initial expression is executed, then the conditional expression is evaluated & then the statement is executed.

* for(i=0;i<5;i++)
* This example above is a simple for loop statement which indicates the initial expression which is (i=0), then the conditional statement implies that the i must be less than 5 & then the statement is completely executed

## while loop
While loop is based on executing the statements before evaluating the condition that states to be true. If the condition is false, the loop will stop executing & then passes the following statement.

* x = 0
* y = 0
* while (x < 5)
{
  x++;
  x+=y;
}

The example above is the loop increments the x & adds value to the y. Once the execution is complete, the condition of x<5 is no longer true & the loop statement stops.
